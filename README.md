# time_tracker

A simple app for tracking time across tasks

## Overview

The purpose of this app was simply to be an exercise for myself to 
experiment with and learn the Flutter framework. It is fairly 
minimalisitic but implements basic functionality. Current features 
include adding a task, deleting a task, switching between tasks, and 
editing the name/elapsed time for a given task.
